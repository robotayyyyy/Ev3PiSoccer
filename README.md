## Propose
I just wana adapt image processing to a simple robot with a casual task, put the ball to the goal. My Idea is using the Raspberry pi for immage processing task and send the message to the EV3 robot via bluetooth. 

## Equipment
1. Raspberry pi (for this work, I used pi3 modelB)
1. pi's battery
1. webcam
1. Lego EV3 

## Software
1. [EV3 software](https://education.lego.com/en-us/downloads/mindstorms-ev3/software) for control robot like a child! It looks kiddy and can handle multi-tasks like a pro! 
1. [pyzo](https://pyzo.org/start.html) for implement python in pi.
